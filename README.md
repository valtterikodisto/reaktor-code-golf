# Reaktor-code-golf

My and [Joni Taajamo's](https://github.com/jonitaajamo) winning implementations for Reaktor Code Golf 2019 competition.

Thank you Reaktor for the amazing competition.

### Assignments &copy; Reaktor:

## [Product of Consecutive Numbers](https://github.com/jonitaajamo/Reaktor-code-golf/blob/master/code/numbers.py)

Our implementation's character count: 137

From list of number find N consecutive numbers which have the largest product.

#### Input

First line of input is a number N. The second line has concatenated lists of numbers.

#### Output

The first N consecutive numbers which have the largest product.

#### Example

Input:

3

535984

Output: 598

## [Jallu Index](https://github.com/jonitaajamo/Reaktor-code-golf/blob/master/code/alko.py)

Our implementation's character count: 85

The code fetches current price of Jaloviina from Alko’s site ( https://www.alko.fi/tuotteet/000706/Jaloviina-/ ), parses it and gives it as an output. The price must be fetched from Alko’s site, you can’t just hard code it to print out the current price ;-)

#### Input

Nothing.

#### Example Output

16,99

## [To Integer](https://github.com/jonitaajamo/Reaktor-code-golf/blob/master/code/to_integer.py)

Our implementation's character count: 115

Just convert some strings to integers, easy huh?

#### Input

Whole numbers in written format separated by spaces. The range of numbers is from zero to nine.

#### Output

Concatenated list of the inputted numbers as digits.

#### Example

Input

zero one two three nine

Output

01239
